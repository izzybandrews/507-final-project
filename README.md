This paper covers the needs and logistics behind developing a model for “Goals Above Replacement” (GAR), an advanced metric 
commonly used in the National Hockey League (NHL). GAR is a single numerical value assigned to each player that comes from weighing the different stats of an individual
during a hockey game which allows efficient and informative player comparison.

This repository contains the code and writen pdf for this project.
